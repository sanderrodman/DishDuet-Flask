INSERT INTO recipes VALUE(32,"Chicha Peruana","PT1H50M","PT2H45M","PT4H35M","Chicha (corn beer). Chicha is made in South and, to a lesser extent, Central America. Unlike African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. An abbreviated version is also made in people''s kitchens. Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill''s help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend attempting this at home. My second crop of corn is about to come in and the results were good enough that I will be doing this again in the near future.","Beverages",0.0,0.0,21.1,0.3,0.0,0.0,3.6,2.7,1.5,0.0,2.7,"0.0","Chicha Peruana Recipe Instructions:  1: Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160Â°F. 2: We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon). We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied. 3: Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora. 4: Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body. 5: Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I''d been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol'' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes. 6: Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with. 7: Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor. 8: Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off. 9: Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling. 10: Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom. 11: This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people''s kitchens. 12: Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles. 13: Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash. 14: Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn. 15: This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per ''normal'' homebrew procedures. 16: This could probably be sparged as usual.");

Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste,  wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar. 2: Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered,  for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture is quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it  cool completely. 3: Start seasoning the eggplants: peel eggplants and slice vertically, 1/8 to 1/4  inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes. 4: Now make the  Bechamel Sauce.  NOTE:  The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest  (professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just until tiny  bubbles appear along the edges.

Slowly add the 6 Tbsp flour, stirring constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and  still being careful not to let it brown. 6: Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings. 7: Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth  and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until  thoroughly incorporated. 8: Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is  brown on both sides. 9: Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the  top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3  inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs. 10: Place a layer of  eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with  breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to  last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg.

There are other  methods of seasoning and roasting but we are always satisfied with the results  this way. 3: Try to buy a whole fillet that is already \ 4:  ( trimmed of  silverskin, fat etc. ) or if you prefer you can buy untrimmed and do it  yourself. 5: The whole filet has a taped part ( called the tail ) and when you  roast, tuck this part under so you can have a more even  piece of meat for  roasting. 6: If the whole filet is too large to fit your roasting pan you may cut  the filet in half and roast the two parts in the pan together. 7: Make sure the  meat comes to room temperature prior to roasting for even roasting which also  helps with tenderness. 8: Rub oil ( we prefer olive ) over the filet and then rub in seasonings such as salt , pepper, paprika, crushed garlic etc. The Montreal  Steak Seasoning is a nice choice ( available in the seasoning or meat sections  of supermarkets ) . 9: Or other people prefer to coat the filet with Dijon mustard  and then roll the filet in  finely crushed black or colored peppercorns prior to roasting. 10: Both ways are delicious. 11: Place the filet on a  roasting rack over the  roasting pan. 12: You can also place the filet over some beef bones in the pan which also act as a rack. 13: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. 14: Place the prepared filet on the rack and  roast 20 minutes ( for a average 5 lb roast- ). Then decrease the temperature to 350F and roast an additional 20 minutes. 15: Remove the filet from the oven and let  sit about 15 minutes before slicing. 16: This total time factor  should produce  medium rare.  A heavier roast will probably need more roasting time and a  smaller roast less time. The sitting times allows for best slicing and lets some of the juices settle etc.    If you prefer you can  check and rely on a meat  thermometer to test so you don''t under or over roast the meat.. 17: Insert  thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. Generally 120 to 130 F is rare  and 130 to 140 F is medium rare. Remember the meat will continue to cook with  \ 18:  out of the oven. 19: Meanwhile make the mushroom sauce ( this is a natural and not thickened sauce ). In a large skillet over medium high heat cook the onion in some olive oil or butter until softened. 20: Add the sliced mushrooms  and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have reduced in  volume by 1/2 and become tender. 21: Add the vermouth, dashes of Worcestershire  sauce and Gravy Master (  a browning/ caramelized color for sauces etc. ). Cook  and stir  another 5 to 10 minutes and then season to taste.   If you wish you   may add a few tablespoons of the pan drippings or a bit of beef bullion paste (  available in jars ) for a richer flavor. 22: The whole recipe really can serve  quite a lot depending on how thick or thin you slice the meat.

Continue to stir with the wooden  spoon while the panade dries out. This will take about 5 minutes, and a  thin crust will form on the bottom of the pan. 7: This is supposed to  happen, so don''t worry about it, and don''t try to scrape it up and  incorporate it into the dough, or you will have plaster chips in your  pastries. 8: The dough should be soft, but when you pinch it between thumb  and forefinger it should not stick to your hand. 9: Dump the panade into a  bowl, and let it cool for at least 5 minutes. 10: Then add the eggs, one at a  time, beating well after each addition. 11: The mixture should be smooth and  creamy looking before you add the next egg. 12: After all 4 eggs have been  beaten in, the dough will be shiny and satiny yellow, thick and heavy. 13: Butter and flour a cookie sheet. Fill a pastry bag with the dough. 14: If you  don''t have a pastry bag, you can use a tablespoon to drop dollops of  dough onto the cookie sheet for eclairs and/or cream puffs, but you  really must have a pastry bag in order to make a cream puff ring. 15: For cream puffs, Squeeze out balls about the size of ping pong or golf  balls. 16: For eclairs, squeeze out oblongs at 3 to 4 inches long. 17: If you are using  the recipe given above, you should end up with 14 to 16 pastries. 18: Don''t  succumb to the temptation to make fewer and larger ones, for they won''t  cook properly if you do. 19: Brush the tops of the pastries with beaten egg,  using the bristles of the brush to gently push down and flatten out the  little curlicues left by the pastry bag as you lifted it off. 20: Finally,  drag the tines of a dinner fork down the length of each eclair. 21: The  resulting stripes will make for a more attractive and professional  looking product. For a cream puff ring, first mark a 10\ 22:  wide \ 23:  of cream puff paste right on top of the circle you''ve  outlined. 24: Squeeze another 1\ 25: crack\ 26: ,  27: ,  28: dry\ 29: ,  30: Bake the former at 375F for about 30 minutes, or until  they have puffed up nicely and turned golden brown. 31: Bake the latter at  400F for about 45 minutes, or until it is well puffed and golden brown. 32: Then, turn the oven off, open the door, and leave it halfway open for an  hour. 33: If it won''t stay ajar by itself, prop it open by wedging something  in there. This is to allow steam to escape and to let the pastries cool  slowly and \ 34:  as they cool so that they won''t collapse or become soft  and soggy. 35: After an hour has passed, remove the pastries from the oven. 36: They are now ready to be filled. 37: To fill individual pastries: Cut cream puffs and eclairs in half (from side to side, not from top to  bottom). Fill with whatever filling you desire. Replace lids. 38: Glaze with  icing or pour sauce on top. 39: Serve. It is wise not to fill pastries to far  in advance of the serving time. The closer the preparation time is to the  serving time, the smaller the likelihood that the pastries will begin to  soften or get soggy. 40: To fill a cream ring:  Use a slicing knife with a long serrated blade to cut the top off a cream  puff ring. 41: Fill the bottom with praline cream (or coffee cream, or  chocolate cream) filling. 42: Fill a pastry bag with sweetened whipped cream. 43: use a nozzle with a zigzag edge (like pinking shears) to squeeze out a  layer of fancy puff-balls of whipped cream all over the layer of praline  cream filling. 44: Finally, replace the lid and dust the top with 10X  powdered confectioners'' sugar. 45: Keep the cream puff ring in a cool dry  place until serving time.                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -                     *  Exported from  MasterCook  *                            PRALINE FILLING Recipe By     : Homemade Good News (Vol 3 No 3) Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00 Categories    : Pastries Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method --------  ------------  --------------------------------  1      cup           10X powdered confectioners'' sugar    1/2  cup           almonds Make the vanilla custard cream. 46: Place the sugar and nuts in a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat.

The following recipe is typical but far   from definitive, especially where the ingredients   for the filling are concerned.

Moisten the hard roll in water, press dry, and put   through the meat grinder (better than the food mill or   food processor), along with the bacon mixture, cooked   spinach, ground meat or smoked farm sausage, leftover   roast, etc.  Then fold in the eggs, parsley, and   seasonings; mix together. 4: The filling should be very   spicy indeed. 5: On a board that has been sprinkled with flour, roll   out the dough into rectangular sheets (about twice as   wide as you want your ''Maultaschen'' to be).  Take a   tablespoon measure and put little dabs of filling at   equally spaced 3-inch intervals all down the middle of   one side of the sheet of dough. 6: Mix together the egg   and canned milk and apply it to the spaces in between,   the outer edge and the fold line.

When the beef is just about done, grind the pepper over the beef, probably about 1 Tbsp worth. 3: Add about 1/2 to 1 Tbsp soy sauce and mix it in to  the beef. 4: You can replace the soy sauce with salt, but it adds a nice zing to the flavor. 5: At this point, I usually cut the onion into chunks and throw it into my Cuisinart with the garlic, and shred them to bits, and toss them in . 6: But sliced into small bits works well also. 7: Add the onion and garlic, and let cook down (covered) until the onion gets a little clear. 8: I add a little oil here sometimes, depending on how much fat was in the meat.

Let cool a bit and then taste. Carefully adjust seasonings in remainder of batter to taste. Repeat this procedure of making one fritter until you have the spices just right. The recipe may seem like a lot of spices, but they lose their strength when mixed with all that stuff and cooked. 16: Serve with lemon or lime wedges, some more habenero sauce, and plenty of cold beverages. 17: And be careful with that hot oil.

Wilton''s is very good. 11: (I use an insulated  sheet, and I just tried the Silverstone baking liners for the first time.  Good idea!) Also, let sheets cool to room temp before second batch. 12: (Or use  freezer to cool sheets faster). Or just use 2 sheets and alternate.)  The cookies won''t look done really but as they sit they solidify   They  are really cakey. 13: As an added treat you can whip up some cream cheese  frosting as a dip, if if you don''t mind them messier just squeeze a couple  lines over finished cookies. 14: Pure delight!  from: Ann and .topsecretrecipes.com.");

Saute toppings until pliable - make them however you like them.  Remove them from pan and set aside. 7: Pour some more oil in the pan (I use olive oil, but if you have access to the stuff they use in restaurants on grills it would taste even better) on medium high heat.  Place 1/4 to 1/3 of a pound of meat in the pan, lying the pieces flat and overlapping to form a shape that will fit nicely in a bun. 8: When the meat turns grey with doneness, flip it over and if you are using cheese slices now is the time to lie them on top of the meat.  Add the other toppings back into the pan next to the meat and allow to reheat.  Cover the pan to allow the cheese to melt.  This should take 1-2 minutes.  If the meat looks overcooked, thats ok - i t should be GRAY. 9: This is the time to toast the bread if you so wish.  I don''t like mine toasted at all.  Warmed is ok. 10: If you are using cheese whiz, warm it in the microwave. Pick up meat and melted cheese with a spatula and deposit on the roll.  IF using cheese whiz, use a butter knife or chopstick to smear whiz next to the meat. 11: Push the meat on one side of the roll and deposit the toppings next to it.

Continue until you have a smooth, elastic ball of dough and the oil is nearly all used. 4: Then roll the ball of dough in the remaining oil to cover all sides, place a  clean cloth over the bowl, and allow the dough to rest for two hours or more in a warm place away from drafts. A barely warm oven is satisfactory. 5: Separate 1/4 of the dough and roll to 1/4 inch thickness on a pastry board rubbed with cornstarch.

Do not worry if it hangs down around the edges of the table, or if some holes appear, especially around the edges. Cut off the thicker edge and save the scraps. 7: The phyllo is now ready to be cut into pieces with scissors if you wish to use it moist. If you prefer dry phyllo, allow it  to sand until dry, about 10 minutes, then cut into desired sizes. 8: The scraps of dough can be put into a moist bowl and kneaded and rolled again. 9: When using phyllo dough, spray the sheets with olive oil or melted butter from a spritzer bottle.

Beating constantly with a large spoon, pour in the water in a thin, slow stream and beat until the flour and water are well blended. 2: Knead the dough in the bowl by pressing it down, pushing it forward several times with the heel of your hand and folding it back on itself. Repeat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the dough can be gathered into a soft, somewhat sticky ball. 3: Add the olive oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, kneading well after each addition and continue kneading for about 25 minutes longer, or until the dough is smooth and satiny. 4: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for at least two hours.  Tightly covered, the dough can be kept at room temperature overnight or in the refrigerator for a week or so. If you refrigerate it, be sure to bring it to room temperature  before rolling it. 5: When you are ready to roll and use the dough, divide it into 20 equal portions and shape each piece into a ball about 1-1/2 inches in diameter. 6: Sprinkle a smoothly woven kitchen towel with a little cornstarch and, one at a time, roll each ball on the towel with a rolling pin into a round about 7 inches in diameter. 7: As they are rolled, place the rounds between strips of wax paper and stack them on a plate. Then cover all the rounds with a kitchen towel and let them rest for about 30 minutes. 8: To shape each sheet of phyllo, stretch it over the backs of your hands by lifting the dough and pulling your hands  apart repeatedly until the phyllo is paper thin. Working quickly but gently, you should be able to form a sheet about 14 inches wide and 18 inches long. Trim off the thick edges to make a 12 by 16-inch rectangle. 9: Freshly made phyllo dries out so quickly that each sheet should be buttered or shaped as described in the recipe you are following before you proceed to roll and stretch the next sheet. 10: A home baker cannot make phyllo as thin as the commercial product; therefore, use only half as many layers as called for in a recipe, and cut the rectangle in half instead of folding it. 11: Allow phyllo dough to thaw in refrigerator overnight. Carefully unroll phyllo sheets onto a smooth, dry surface  Cover phyllo completely with plastic wrap, then a damp towel. 12: Keep phyllo covered until needed  Do not leave it uncovered  for more than a couple of minutes to avoid drying out. 13: Microwave butter until very soft, but not melted. This will give you a lighter and flakier pastry. 14: Brush each layer of phyllo with very soft or melted butter, margarine or oil. To prevent edges from cracking, brush edges first and work into center.  Be sure to brush the last layer of phyllo with melted butter. 15: Fillings should be chilled and not excessively moist Generally, bake on ungreased cookie sheet in preheated 375Â°F oven until golden brown. For thicker items, reduce heat to 350Â°F. 16: Phyllo may  be rolled and refrozen to store, when not in use. Tip: Use approximately 1/2 cup butter or oil for 16 sheets phyllo dough.

You can also add a sprig or two of rosemary to it and if you want baste the lamb a couple of times while it''s roasting. Just before serving bring the liquid to a simmer on the stove top, making sure you whisk it well and scrape all the bits from the sides and the bottom of the pan. If you want more gravy you can add some extra stock or some of the water you have cooked your vegetables inches Mix 1tbsp of cornflour with 2tbsp of water and whisk it into the stock.

Remove skin from thighs. (trim fat deposits and rinse all chicken thoroughly) This step is critical. 2: Cut all chicken pieces in half.  This exposes the crucial bone marrow. The more marrow you expose, the better the sauce. I chop the wings into 4 or five pieces. Do not add giblets and neck. 3: In large pot, combine chicken, salt, Paprika, chicken base, and  enough water to just cover the chicken pieces. 4: Cook, partially covered, at such temperature that a simmer to very gentle boil is achieved. You want just a bit of bubbling. 5: Do so until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and easily removed from the bone--About  1.5 hrs. (I cook the chicken until it is on the verge of falling off the bone.  This extracts maximum flavor from the chicken.) 6: Strain mixture to separate liquid and chicken.  Place chicken into a warm serving dish. 7: Return liquid to pot, and vigorously mix in sour cream and milk. I use a whisk for this. Carefully bring the sauce to a boil and remove immediately from heat. Failure to remove promptly will result in very messy boiling over! 8: Set burner to it''s lowest setting and return pot to the burner to keep sauce hot.  The sauce is basically finished at this point.  You may wish to fine tune by adding more salt, sour cream, Paprika, and/or chicken base. I sometimes add a 1/2 cup or so of heavy cream for added richness. You may also want to skim most of the liquid fat from the sauce surface. 9: Noodles procedure: Combine flour, salt, and eggs in a hemispherical bowl large enough to accommodate mixing. 10: Add about 1/2 cup water and proceed to blend ingredients with a fork until well blended. The consistency your striving for is such that the dough is clearly wet, adheres to the bowl, and is loose enough to slowly spread out when a dollop is applied to the cutting board. Add enough water to achieve this. I''ve never measured how much water I use, but think it''s about 1/2 cup plus some.  Actually, the consistency is not critical. I''m guessing you''ve made noodles (or dumplings) like this, and that additional, excruciating explanation is not necessary. 11: Set a Dutch oven (good size pot) 2/3 full of water to boil. At this point, obviously the dough goes into the water. I place a good size dollop on a small cutting board and use a gently curved, sharp knife to cut perhaps 1/2\ 12: ,  13: ,  14: Finally: At this point you should have a pot of wonderful sauce, a bowl full of chicken pieces, and a bowl of noodles. For serving, place a good serving of noodles and half  (maybe less) as much chicken into a flat bowl. Apply enough sauce to almost cover noodles and chicken. 15: You may want to salt to taste. My wife likes pepper on it. I do not. In any case, Viola!    That''s it. I really want you to try this, as everyone on both sides of our family loves it. My instructions are laborious because attention paid to various details will produce a superb dish, while an average effort with average ingredients  produce a result that is only very good.");

It should be like a pie crust dough, not a bread dough. 4: Take a ball of dough, about 150 grams in weight and roll with a pin until you have thin 50cm diameter circle.

You must constantly reposition the piece on the work surface, rolling it up onto the pin on occasion and flipping it over and unrolling it to work the other side. It mustn''t stick to the work surface so make sure there is a dusting of flour on the surface at all times.  You can''t work the dough too much or it will absorb the flour and become stiff and unusable.
